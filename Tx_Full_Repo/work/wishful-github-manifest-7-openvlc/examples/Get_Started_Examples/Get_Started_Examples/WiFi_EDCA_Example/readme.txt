============================================

In this example, we explain how to use WiSHFUL Framework. 


# Requirements
--------------
Install WiSHFUL Framework on each nodes you will use. 


# Configuration
---------------
There are two configuration files. 


# Running Example
-----------------
Start Controller on one node in network:

	./wishful_simple_controller --config ./controller_config.yaml

Start Agents of multiple nodes in network:

	./wishful_simple_agent --config ./agent_config.yaml
